Introduction
The current course evaluation platform at Habib University is tedious and unreasonably complex. Currently, it forces the students to go through a list of courses offered in that semester and fill in the evaluations for the courses they are enrolled in that semester. 
The objective of our project is to allow the students to effortlessly complete their course and professor evaluations. We aim to do this by developing a web-based platform. This platform will serve two purposes for the students; allow them to complete their course/professor evaluations and read anonymized reviews of past courses/professors.
